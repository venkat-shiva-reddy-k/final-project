            <p>The Orchard Road district, which is dominated by multi-storey shopping centres and hotels, can be considered 
				the center of tourism in Singapore. Other popular tourist attractions include the Singapore Zoo, River Safari
				and Night Safari, which allows people to explore Asian, African and American habitats at night without any 
				visible barriers between guests and the wild animals. The Singapore Zoo has embraced the 'open zoo' 
				concept whereby animals are kept in enclosures, separated from visitors by hidden dry or wet moats, 
				instead of caging the animals, while the River Safari, features 10 different ecosystems around the world, 
				including the River Nile, Yangtze River, Mississippi, Amazon as well as the Tundra and has 300 species of animals, 
				including numerous endangered species.</p>

            <p>Guns from the World War II era can be seen at Fort Siloso, from a mini-sized to a 16 pound (7 kg) gun. 
				Moreover, the island also consists of the Sentosa Luge, a small one- or two-person sled on which one 
				sleighs supine and feet-first. Steering is done by shifting the weight or pulling straps attached to 
				the sled's runners. Among the latest tourists attractions built in Singapore includes the two integrated 
				resorts which houses casinos, namely Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa, a Universal Studios theme 
				park, Gardens by the Bay and Jewel Changi Airport.</p>
