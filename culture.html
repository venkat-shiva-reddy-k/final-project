            </u>
            <p>The culture of Singapore has changed greatly over the millennia. Its contemporary modern culture consists
                of a combination of Asian and European cultures, mainly by Malay, South Asian, East Asian and Eurasian
                influences. Singapore has been dubbed as a country where "East meets West", "Gateway to Asia" and a
                "Garden city".</p>
            <br>
            <p>Singapore's indigenous culture originates primarily from the Austronesian people that arrived from the
                island of Taiwan, settling between 1500 to 1000 BCE. It was then influenced during the Middle Ages
                primarily by multiple Chinese dynasties such as the Ming and Qing, as well as by other Asian countries
                such as the Majapahit Empire, Tokugawa shogunate, and the Ryukyu Kingdom. In the near-contemporary
                history after the British arrived, Singapore was also influenced by western countries. Repeated
                influence, absorption and selection in various ways have added to the development of a distinct and
                unique culture.</p>
