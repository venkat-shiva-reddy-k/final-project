            <p>Singapore attracted approximately 18.5 million visitors in 2018, according to Singapore Tourism Board. 
				This number increased by 6.2 percent from 2017, which likely is due to an increase in arrivals from Asia, 
				USA, and the United Kingdom. Top three markets included visitors from China, Indonesia, and India, due to 
				strong travel demand and increased flight connectivity. Indian travel also escalated due to new cruise 
				offerings from top cruise lines. Overall, 14 out of Singapore's top 15 markets were able to log growth 
				in the 2018 year and are expected to continue doing so through 2019. Speaking monetarily, increase of 
				tourism receipts was largely due to growth in entertainment, gaming and sightseeing. </p>
