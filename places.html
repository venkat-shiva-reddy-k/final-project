                    <p>Singapore's Merlion is just what it sounds likeâ€”the figure of a mythical creature that has the
                        head
                        of a lion and the body and tail of a fish. The Merlion represents the city's humble start as a
                        fishing village combined with its traditional Malay name Singapura, "lion city."</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The structure, which was relocated to Merlion Park in 2002, where it can overlook Marina Bay,
                        weighs
                        70 tonnes and stands at 8.6 meters tall, spouting water from its mouth in a fountain.</p>

                    <p>Singapore isn't exactly known as a beach destination, but if you're really craving some fun in
                        the sun, Sentosa Island is the place to find it. Siloso Beach is a good spot for getting in
                        beach time, and visitors can play volleyball on free courts or go kayaking and skimboarding.
                        There are several other beach attractions as well, plus an Underwater World aquarium, where you
                        can swim with dolphins.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A must-see on Sentosa Island is the Merlion, Singapore's famous statue that has the head of a
                        lion and the body of a fish. You can take an escalator to the top of the statue and enjoy
                        panoramic views of the surrounding area.</p>

                    <h2 class="sub-title">3. &nbsp; Chinatown</h2>
                    <p>If you've ever visited China, Singapore's Chinatown neighborhood will bring you right back here.
                        From the small mom-and-pop stores and authentic Chinese food to the bright red lanterns, there's
                        excitement and hustle in this district. You can visit the Chinese Heritage Centre and see the
                        impressive and beautiful Sri Mariamman Hindu temple.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Another temple worth seeing is the Buddha Tooth Relic temple. If you're up early enough (think
                        4am), you can hear the morning drum ceremony. Or you can just check out the closing ceremony in
                        the evening after viewing the relic.</p>
